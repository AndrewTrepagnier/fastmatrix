## Fastmatrix

Exploring speed and optimization in matrix calculations with different optimized python forks!



## Project Introduction

This project, at its premise, is a token to the truth that we live in a world that rewards systems that can do more with less. Systems, whether biological or technological, require energy and resources to perform work.

This is the concept of evolution that is continuously elucidating itself into technology every single day. It is best said by David Ha and his research team at Sakana AI, Google DeepMind as:



`"At a time when computational resources seem abundant, there is much excitement around scaling up machine learning and training increasingly larger models on bigger datasets. Intelligent life, however, has arisen not from an abundance of resources, but rather from the lack of it."`

This project was inspired by this philosophy — that optimization should be a consideration in every step of the process because at ground level that is what an "intelligent" system is.

I explore speed and efficiency in this project, something I used to never worry about when first learning to code. I start with the basics building out matrix operations suites in Cython, and will explore other avenues(PYPY, Pyjion, Mojo, RustPython, ect.) in the future. 


By benchmarking a simple matrix operation (element-wise squaring over many iterations) in both pure Python and Cython, this project demonstrates:



How Python code can be translated into compiled extensions

How major performance improvements can be gained without sacrificing readability

Why optimization at the fundamental level still matters, even in the era of abundant compute

This is not just about performance — it’s a meditation on efficiency as an art form.
